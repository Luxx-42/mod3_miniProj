Here's your Contact Management System - it's like your digital Rolodex but way more fun and powered by the command line. Here's the scoop:

***What Can You Do Here?

- Add New Buddies: Got someone new in your life? Just add them with their name, phone, email, and any extra notes you want to keep. 
- Tweak Your Friends' Info: Made a mistake or someone's details changed? No stress, just edit what you need.

- Remove Old Contacts: When you're ready to let go, delete those contacts you don't need anymore.

- Find Someone: Can't remember where you saved that info? Search by name, phone, or email to jog your memory.

- See Everyone: Want to see all your contacts in one place? Just ask, and I'll show them to you.

- Back Up or Share: Export your contacts to a text file, so you can keep a backup or share with friends.

- Bring in New Contacts: Got contacts from somewhere else? Import them into my system easily.

***Getting Started

**Grab the Code: 

- git clone <your-repository-URL>
- cd Contact-Management-System

**What You'll Need: 
- Just Python 3.x (I've tested it with 3.8 or later). No extra libraries needed; it's all Python's built-in magic.

***How to Use It

**Just run:

- bash
- python contact_manager.py

***You'll be greeted with a friendly welcome and a menu that looks like this:

1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Import contacts from a text file
8. Quit

***Little Details:

- Adding: Use someone's phone number as their ID, then fill in the rest.
- Editing: Find them by their number, then update what needs changing.
- Deleting: Type in their phone number, and they're gone.
- Searching: Type anything you remember about them to find their record.
- Displaying: See all your contacts listed out.
- Exporting/Importing: Choose a file name, and I'll handle moving contacts in or out. Here's how it looks:
- Export Example:
  Phone: 1234567890
  name: John Doe
  email: john@example.com
  additional: Some notes

- Import: Your file needs to look just like that for me to read it right.
